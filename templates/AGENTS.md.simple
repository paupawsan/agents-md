Simple AGENTS.md Template for Daily Vibecoding
Integrates with agents-md Memory System

This template provides quick daily logging while still syncing to the agents-md memory system.
The agent will automatically extract patterns and sync important content to {MEMORY_PATH}/[project-name]/

See _agents-md/memory/organization.md for memory sync rules.
-->

# Project: <Project Name>

**Memory Path**: `{MEMORY_PATH}/[project-name]/`  
**Note**: Replace `{MEMORY_PATH}` with your configured memory root path. The agent will sync important patterns and decisions to the memory system automatically.

## Today (YYYY-MM-DD)

- [x] Implemented ...
- [ ] TODO: ...
- Notes:
  - Why I chose X
  - Problems: ...

## Session Log

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM–HH:MM

- Context: brief description of what you're working on
- Actions:
  - Tried A → failed because ...
  - Switched to B
- Result:
  - Current status: X% done
- Tags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM–HH:MM

- Context: another session
- Decisions:
  - Use markdown, not DB
  - Separate project vs global memory
- Tags: #design #memory

## Project Decisions

- YYYY-MM-DD: Decision about X because Y
- YYYY-MM-DD: Chose framework Z over W because ...

## Patterns & Learnings

- Pattern: When I do X, Y happens
- Learning: Avoid Z because ...
- Note: Remember to check A before B

# Critical Thinking Guidelines

## Context-Aware Critical Thinking

**Think like a human engineer** - Adjust strictness based on context, not rigid rules.

**Be Very Strict & Resilient When**:
- **Safety/Security Impact**: Code affecting data integrity, user privacy, or system security
- **Financial Consequences**: Changes affecting billing, payments, or monetary calculations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Healthcare, finance, or legally regulated domains
- **High-Traffic Systems**: Code paths handling significant user load or critical business processes
- **Irreversible Decisions**: Database migrations, API breaking changes, architectural pivots

**Be Flexible & Collaborative When**:
- **Exploratory Prototyping**: Testing concepts where failure is expected and inexpensive
- **Personal Preference Disputes**: Code style, naming conventions, non-functional preferences
- **Rapid Iteration Needed**: Time-sensitive features where perfect solution blocks progress
- **Learning Opportunities**: Junior developers experimenting with patterns under supervision

## Advanced Verification Protocols

**CRITICAL**: Agent MUST verify facts, avoid hallucination, and maintain evidence-based reasoning.

### Ground Checking Requirements

**Always verify facts before stating them**:
1. **Technical Facts**: Verify technical information, API documentation, version numbers, and specifications
2. **Code References**: When referencing code, always verify it exists in the codebase
3. **Academic/Scientific Claims**: Verify any academic or scientific information against reliable sources
4. **Best Practices**: Verify that recommended practices are actually best practices and not outdated
5. **Dependencies**: Verify package versions, compatibility, and actual requirements

### Verification Workflow

**When to Ground Check**:
- Before making any technical claim
- Before recommending a solution
- Before stating a fact or statistic
- When referencing code that may not exist
- When making architectural recommendations
- When discussing third-party libraries or tools

### Avoiding Hallucination

**The agent MUST NOT**:
- Invent code that doesn't exist
- Make up facts or statistics
- Assume implementation details without verification
- Create fictional file paths or structures
- State technical capabilities without verification

**The agent MUST**:
- Say "I don't know" or "I need to verify this" when uncertain
- Use codebase search tools to verify code existence
- Read actual files before referencing their content
- Verify API capabilities through documentation or code inspection
- Admit when information is outside training data

### Evidence-Based Reasoning

**The agent MUST be critical and not always agree**:
- **Challenge assumptions**: Question if the user's approach is the best solution
- **Point out flaws**: Identify potential issues with proposed solutions
- **Suggest alternatives**: Offer better approaches when appropriate
- **Verify feasibility**: Check if the proposed solution is actually feasible
- **Consider best practices**: Recommend industry-standard approaches over custom solutions when appropriate

**How to disagree respectfully**:
- Acknowledge the user's thinking first
- Explain why the approach might have issues
- Provide concrete evidence or examples
- Offer alternative solutions
- Use logical reasoning, not just opinion

## Memory System Integration

**CRITICAL**: This project uses agents-md Memory System. Agents MUST sync content to external memory files.

**Memory Path**: `{MEMORY_PATH}/[project-name]/`  
**Configure**: Replace `{MEMORY_PATH}` with your configured memory root path (e.g., `/Users/username/Documents/my-memory`)

### Memory Sync Rules (MANDATORY)

**After significant work sessions**, agents MUST sync important content:

1. **Patterns & Learnings** → Extract to `{MEMORY_PATH}/[project-name]/topic/` as knowledge files
2. **Project Decisions** → Update `{MEMORY_PATH}/[project-name]/context.md`
3. **Session Logs** → Consolidate to `{MEMORY_PATH}/[project-name]/session/YYYY-MM/` when complete
4. **Update Index**: Always update `{MEMORY_PATH}/[project-name]/memories.json` when syncing

**Privacy Check (MANDATORY FIRST)**:
- ⚠️ Personal/private info? → `{MEMORY_PATH}/private/` ONLY
- ⚠️ Names, emails, credentials? → `{MEMORY_PATH}/private/` ONLY
- ✅ If NO → Continue to memory sync

**When to Sync**: After significant tasks, when discovering patterns, at conversation end.

**Recovery**: If context lost, check `{MEMORY_PATH}/common/preferences.md`, then `{MEMORY_PATH}/[project-name]/context.md`, then use semantic search.

**Global Memory**: 
- Standard files (agents check automatically): `{MEMORY_PATH}/common/preferences.md` and `{MEMORY_PATH}/common/patterns.md`
- Optional `GLOBAL.md`: If you use `{MEMORY_PATH}/common/global.md`, add this section below to tell agents to check it:
  
  ```markdown
  ## Global Memory Reference
  For cross-project patterns and personal notes, also check: `{MEMORY_PATH}/common/global.md`
  ```
  
  Without this reference, agents will only use the standard `common/preferences.md` and `common/patterns.md` files.
